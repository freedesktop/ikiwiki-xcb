[Xlib](http://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/introduction/) has been the standard C binding for the [X Window System](http://xorg.freedesktop.org) protocol for many years now. It is an excellent piece of work, but there are applications for which it is not ideal, for example

- Small platforms: Xlib is a large piece of code, and it is difficult to make it smaller.
- Latency hiding: Xlib requests requiring a reply are effectively synchronous: they block until the reply appears, whether the result is needed immediately or not.
- Direct access to the protocol: Xlib does quite a bit of caching, layering, and similar optimizations. While this is normally a feature, it makes it difficult to simply emit specified X protocol requests and process specific responses.
- Threaded applications: While Xlib does attempt to support multithreading, the API makes this difficult and error-prone.
- New extensions: The Xlib infrastructure provides limited support for the creation of X extension client side code.

### XCB: an X protocol C Binding

For these reasons, among others, we are working on XCB, an X protocol C Binding which is designed to solve the above problems and thus provide a base for

- Toolkit implementation.
- Direct protocol-level programming.
- Lightweight emulation of commonly used portions of the Xlib API (in progress, see [[XlibXcb]]).
