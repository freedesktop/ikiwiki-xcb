The X protocol C-language Binding (XCB) is a replacement for Xlib [[featuring|Features]] a small footprint, latency hiding, direct access to the protocol, improved threading support, and extensibility.

You can obtain released versions of XCB from <http://xcb.freedesktop.org/dist> . Follow the instructions from the [[DevelopersGuide]] to build, except that you can use released versions of the dependencies, and you don't need git, automake, autoconf, or libtool.

The [[XcbApi]] is documented. There is also a [tutorial](http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=xcb;a=tree;f=xcb/doc/tutorial).

To aid porting applications, you can configure Xlib to use XCB for the transport layer. We call this [[Xlib/XCB|XlibXcb]].

If you wish to work on XCB, please read the [[DevelopersGuide]]. Discussion of XCB and Xlib/XCB is through the [XCB mailing list](http://www.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/xcb).

The XCB project has a long [[history]], during which it has produced many academic [[publications]].
