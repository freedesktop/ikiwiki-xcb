The xcb-util module provides a number of libraries which sit on top of libxcb, the core X protocol library, and some of the extension libraries. These experimental libraries provide convenience functions and interfaces which make the raw X protocol more usable. Some of the libraries also provide client-side code which is not strictly part of the X protocol but which have traditionally been provided by Xlib.


These libraries are currently included, roughly ordered by maturity: 

- render-util: Convenience functions for the Render extension. 
- aux: Convenient access to connection setup and some core requests. 
- atom: Standard core X atom constants and atom caching. 
- property: Callback X property-change handling. 
- icccm: Both client and window-manager helpers for ICCCM. 
- keysyms: Standard X key constants and conversion to/from keycodes. 
- event: Callback X event handling. 
- image: Port of Xlib's XImage and XShmImage functions. 
- Framework for window manager implementation. 

The online API documentation can be found [here](/XcbUtil/api/), and can be built using doxygen.
