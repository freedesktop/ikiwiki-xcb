### Xlib/XCB: Mixing Xlib and XCB Calls

One of the nice features of Xlib/XCB is that it supports a gradual transition from Xlib to XCB, by permitting mixing Xlib and XCB calls in programs. Of course, you need to be running a new enough version of Xlib to get Xlib/XCB, and not have turned the XCB support off.

To mix calls, you'll need both an XCB connection and Xlib display. Get this by using XOpenDisplay() to get an Xlib Display, then calling XGetXCBConnection() (from "Xlib-xcb.h") on the Xlib Display to get an XCBConnection.

You can now mix calls to XCB and Xlib. The datatypes of the two systems are somewhat interoperable; for example, you can use an Xlib Window anywhere an xcb\_window\_t is required. In general, XID types like Window (X.h:typedef XID) are synonymous with their XCB equivalents.

Only one of Xlib and XCB can manage the event queue. By default, Xlib does. To change this, call XSetEventQueueOwner() (from "Xlib-xcb.h").
