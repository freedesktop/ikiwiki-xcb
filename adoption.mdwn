Several projects have started using XCB.

* Xlib itself has replaced Xtrans with XCB for the low-level transport layer (see [[XlibXcb]]).
* The [Cairo](http://cairographics.org/) library has an experimental XCB backend.
* Vincent Torri has worked to port **evas** canvas component of [Enlightenment](http://www.enlightenment.org/) from Xlib to XCB.
* The recent MPX (multi-pointer) extension was prototyped using XCB.
* Work is ongoing to port selected default X apps from Xlib and Xt to XCB.
* [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org), a window manager, uses XCB instead of Xlib.

In addition, there are a number of [demos](http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=xcb/demo.git) available from the XCB repository.
