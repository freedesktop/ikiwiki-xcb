Several projects have started using XCB.

* Xlib itself has replaced Xtrans with XCB for the low-level transport layer (see [[XlibXcb]]).
* The <http://cairographics.org/> library has an experimental XCB backend.
* Vincent Torri has worked to port **evas** canvas component of <http://www.enlightenment.org/> from Xlib to XCB.
* Work is ongoing to port selected default X apps from Xlib and Xt to XCB.

In addition, there are a number of [demos](http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=xcb/demo.git) available from the XCB repository.
