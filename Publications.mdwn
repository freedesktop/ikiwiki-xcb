## Acknowledgements

The authors are grateful to [[KeithPackard]] for his advice and assistance with X and XCB issues both philosophical and technical, and to Xlib author [[JimGettys]] for his advice and support. We are also grateful to [[AndyHowe]] for his efforts in testing XCB and finding ways to improve its implementation and documentation, and in implementing a significant portion of XCL.

In addition, we thank the [Usenix](http://www.usenix.org) Association for their financial and staff support of ALS and the XFree86 Technical Conference. A Student Stipend awarded by the Usenix Association made it possible for Jamey to attend the 2001 XFree86 Technical Conference.
