## Releasing XCB Modules

(based on cairo's release process) (requires the maintainer to have a gpg key to sign the tag)

<i>Note that many of these steps can be automated by the [[X.Org `release.sh` script|http://www.x.org/wiki/Development/Documentation/ReleaseHOWTO/]] now.</i>

1. Update README

1. Update NEWS

  - `git shortlog <last version>..`
  - Skip any fixes to bugs that didn't exist in the last release
  - Skip any typos or similar cosmetic changes

1. Bump the package version in the top-level configure.ac

1. Commit changed README, NEWS, and configure.ac

  - `git commit -m "Release <name> <version>"`

1. check that **all** your changes are committed

  - `git status` must not show any uncommitted files and you must be on the
    `master` branch
  - `git diff HEAD` must not show anything

1. `autoreconf -vfi && ./configure && make distcheck`

1. Tag the repository

  - `git tag -s -m "Release <name> <version>" <version>`
  - verify with `git verify-tag <version>`

1. Compose the release mail (but don't send yet!)

  - template off of last release mail
      - replace version, README, NEWS
      - git tag and keysign
      - MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 checksums + URL's of tarballs (`md5sum`, `sha1sum`, `sha256sum`)
      - note names of releasers

1. Push the master branch and the tag with `git push origin master <version>`

1. Copy the .gz and .bz2 tarballs to
   `xcb.freedesktop.org:/srv/xcb.freedesktop.org/dist/` so they show up at
   <http://xcb.freedesktop.org/dist/>

1. For libxcb, upload the doxygen generated docs from your build to `xcb.freedesktop.org:/srv/xcb.freedesktop.org/manual` so they show up at <http://xcb.freedesktop.org/manual/>

  - `make && rsync -ar --progress --delete doc/manual/ xcb.freedesktop.org:/srv/xcb.freedesktop.org/manual`

1. Send the release mail to xorg and xcb lists

  - Subject: `[ANNOUNCE] <name> <version>`
  - To: <xcb@lists.freedesktop.org>, <xorg-announce@lists.freedesktop.org>,
    <xorg@lists.freedesktop.org>
  - don't forget to GPG-sign the email

1. Update the xcb wiki (news section on the main page, if necessary)

1. If necesssary, ask a bugzilla admin (alanc, keithp, or one of the
freedesktop sitewranglers) to add the new version numbers to the XCB product
in [[bugzilla|https://bugs.freedesktop.org/]].
