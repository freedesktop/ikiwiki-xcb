# Porting Applications to XCB

This page provides information and resources about porting applications from Xlib to XCB. It discusses the Xlib Compatibility Layer (XCL), provides various examples, conglomerates past mailing list posts related to poring the functionality of various applications to XCB, and hopefully will become an important reference for developers who wish to utalize the power and simplicity of XCB by reprogramming their applications to it.

## The XCL

As mentioned [[elsewhere|xcb]], the Xlib Compatibility Layer (XCL) emulates Xlib but is built on XCB. This allows current applications built with Xlib to begin leaveraging XCB's capabilities slowly over time; the entire program doesn't have to be ported immediatly. Rather, it can continue to use various Xlib functions, data types, etc. while also using XCB's methods, structures, and other resources simultaniously.
