This page provides information and resources about porting applications from Xlib to XCB. It discusses the Xlib Compatibility Layer, provides various examples, conglomerates past mailing list posts related to poring the functionality of various applications to XCB, and hopefully will become an important reference for developers who wish to utilize the power and simplicity of XCB by reprogramming their applications to it.

# The XCL

As mentioned [[elsewhere|xcb]], the Xlib Compatibility Layer or XCL for short emulates Xlib but is built on XCB. This allows current applications built with Xlib to begin leveraging XCB's capabilities slowly over time; the entire program doesn't have to be ported immediately. Rather, it can continue to use various Xlib functions, data types, etc. while also using XCB's facilities, structures, and other resources simultaneously.

Before beginning to use the XCL, it is highly recommended that you read [[JameySharp]] and [[BartMassey]]'s paper _[XCL: An Xlib Compatibility Layer for XCB](http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix02/tech/freenix/sharp.html)_. (There are also other formats and sources where this document can be found. See the [[Publications|xcb]] section of the [[XCB homepage|xcb]].)

## Using the XCL

To begin using the XCL just include the header file `xcl.h` rather than `Xlib.h`. After doing so, you will be able to a large majority of Xlib functions and types; XCB's functions, macros, data types, etc; and some convenient macros for converting Xlib types to XCB types.

### Functions and Macros Available in xcl.h

The following functions provided by `xcl.h` can be used to cast from Xlib types to XCB types:

[[XCBConnectionOfDisplay]], [[XCLATOM]], [[XCLBUTTON]], [[XCLCOLORMAP]], [[XCLCURSOR]], [[XCLDRAWABLE]], [[XCLFONT]], [[XCLFONTABLE]], [[XCLGCONTEXT]], [[XCLKEYCODE]], [[XCLKEYSYM]], [[XCLPIXMAP]], [[XCLTIMESTAMP]], [[XCLVISUALID]], [[XCLWINDOW]], [[XSetEventQueueOwner]]

Follow the function's link to see its prototype and an example of how to use it.
