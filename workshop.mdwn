We're planning a four-day XCB Workshop, for anyone interested in XCB's
development, with travel sponsorship available from the X.org
Foundation.

The poll lists the first day and you should check whether the following
three days are available for you as well. That is, the choices are:

- March 20-23
- June 12-15
- June 16-19
- September 4-7

# Location

The workshop will be held in Portland, Oregon, USA. The precise location
is not yet decided, but will probably be at the [Portland State
University](http://pdx.edu/) campus.

# Agenda

Two parts have been proposed: technical work and a documentation sprint.
The technical work could cover new design and implementation, and would
definitely include some bug triage and fixing sessions.

Please add your ideas for issues we should address in the workshop here:

- keyboard support
- first-class request queue API
