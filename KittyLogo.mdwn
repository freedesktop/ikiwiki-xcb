Gear√≥id Molloy of the fine webcomic [Neko the Kitty](http://www.nekothekitty.net/) was kind enough to donate a [drawing](KittyLogo/graphics.png) of a cute kitty that will eventually become the new XCB logo. Philipp Heise set the image against the XCB text and then did a nice vectorization of it to turn it into a candidate logo in [SVG](KittyLogo/nekosvg.svg); he also rendered it as a [PNG](KittyLogo/nekosvg.png).
