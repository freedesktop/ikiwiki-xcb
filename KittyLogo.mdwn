Gear√≥id Molloy of the fine webcomic [Neko the Kitty](http://www.nekothekitty.net/) was kind enough to donate a drawing of a cute kitty that will eventually become the new XCB logo.

Philipp Heise set the image against the XCB text and then did a nice vectorization of it to turn it into a candidate logo in [SVG](KittyLogo/nekosvg.svg). He also rendered it as a PNG.
