# XCBConnectionOfDisplay

## Function Prototype

    XCBConnection *XCBConnectionOfDisplay(Display *dpy);

## Example

    #include <X11/xcl.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main()
    {
        Display *dpy = XOpenDisplay(NULL);
        XCBConnection *c;

        if (! dpy)
        {
            fprintf(stderr, "Could not open display.\n");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }

        /* Now that we have an open `Display' object, cast it to an
         * `XCBConnection' object so it can be used with native XCB
         * functions.
         */
        c = XCBConnectionOfDisplay(dpy);

        if (! c)
        {
            fprintf(stderr, "Could not cast the Display object to an "
                            "XCBConnection object.\n");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }

        /* Do something meaningful, fun, and interesting with the new XCBConnection object. */

        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }

Keep in mind that the `Display` object that this function takes **isn't** the one you may be used to from past Xlib programming. It is declared like this:

    TODO: Fill in the Display struct declaration...

This is significant because its additional member `xcl` can be used to access various members such as `connection` (which is all this function really does). With this in mind, you can do things such as ...
