_To Do_ list:

- Want adoption of libxcb and xcb-proto
  - evas and ecore: in progress (caro)
  - Cairo: in progress (iano)
    - Need to get the test suite to pass
    - Need X resource database support for anti-aliasing properties
    - Need to match the cairo-xlib public API
    - Port cairo-xlib to require Xlib/XCB and delegate to cairo-xcb
  - GTK+: need reviewer for existing bits
    - Existing bits seem to use old version?
    - Organizational interface help from bart, cworth, keithp?
  - Qt: Need help (from zrusin?)
  - Wine, gstreamer (may fix locking issues), mplayer
- Vincent, Ian, Thomas: utils stuff
  - split out libs we care about and release them (notably renderutil, aux)
  - renderutil may have more extensions to the glyph abstractions coming
- Josh, Thomas, Ian, Jeremy:
  - Switch to python from XSLT
  - Deal with 'make dist' properly
- Vincent and Thomas Hunger: protocol documentation in XML + generating Doxygen comments
- Ian: start porting xorg/apps to XCB
  - Some apps are to be dropped in X.org 7.3: don't bother with those (see some page on xorg.fd.o)
- Jeremy: versioning in the XML protocol descriptions
- Jamey and Bart: clean up XCB transport layer code, so people can grok it
- Someone: Finish MPX/XKB/XI extensions
- Someone: extensions need review and possibly new versions
- Someone: X resource database utility library
- Someone: Unit testing XCB
- Someone: server-side XCB
- Someone: finish xhsb
- Someone: design and implement an X-independent library for pixel format conversion
- Someone: implement some of the most ugly functions of glx (in util ?)
- Vincent: wants review/help with the XCB tutorial. We should get it into the wiki.
