_To Do_ list:

- Get ikiwiki up: need CGI and final setup
- Want adoption of libxcb and xcb-proto
  - evas and ecore: in progress (caro)
  - Cairo: in progress (iano)
    - Try to target "supported" status for upcoming Cairo 1.4 release
    - Need to get the test suite to pass
    - Need X resource database support for anti-aliasing properties
    - Need to match the cairo-xlib public API
    - Port cairo-xlib to require Xlib/XCB and delegate to cairo-xcb
  - GTK+: need reviewer for existing bits
    - Existing bits seem to use old version?
    - Organizational interface help from bart, cworth, keithp?
  - Qt: Need help
  - Xine bits from christoph4: need to review
- Vincent, Ian, Thomas: utils stuff
  - finish renaming
  - release an 0.2
  - split out libs we care about and release them (notably renderutil, maybe aux)
  - renderutil may have more extensions to the glyph abstractions coming
- Thomas, with help: release management (util or libxcb first?)
- Josh, Thomas, Ian, Jeremy:
  - Switch to python from XSLT
  - Deal with 'make dist' properly
- Vincent and Jeremy: protocol documentation in XML + generating Doxygen comments
- Ian: start porting xorg/apps to XCB
  - Some apps are to be dropped in X.org 7.3: don't bother with those (see some page on xorg.fd.o)
- Josh and Ian: produce a better locking-bug message with backtrace on glibc
- Jeremy: versioning in the XML protocol descriptions
- Jamey and Bart: clean up XCB transport layer code, so people can grok it
- Bart: XCB workshop in mid/late August
- Someone: Finish MPX/XKB/XI extensions
- Someone: extensions need review and possibly new versions
- Someone: X resource database utility library
- Someone: Unit testing XCB
- Someone: server-side XCB
- Someone: finish xhsb
- Someone: design and implement an X-independent library for pixel format conversion
- XCB needs a kitten logo
  - **iano:** [aside] I nominate a neko from the demo/neko
  - **iano:** [aside] because everyone would love X if they knew it ran on kittens :)
  - **JoshTriplett:** every time you use Xlib, God kills a kitten. Please, think of the kittens.
  - **iano:** JoshTriplett: no that was reserved for XKB (== X Kitten Butcher)
  - **\*\*\*cworth** likes the kitten idea
  - **Bart\_Massey:** Yep; need a cute kitten. Check
  - **JoshTriplett:** Lack of logo-design skill notwithstanding, I think we should just come up with our own original neko or kitten.
  - **JoshTriplett:** Bart\_Massey: Design thought: simplistic like the neko seems like a feature, given XCB's focus on simplicity and transparency.
- Vincent: wants review/help with the XCB tutorial. We should get it into the wiki.
