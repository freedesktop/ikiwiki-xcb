Trail through XCB install

- When logging in to my account I should see some home page or other, not an opportunity to change my account data.
- The svc download worked fine, once I figured out that 'svc login looks' like it did absolutely nothing. Yes, I know that's the Unix paradigm but even UNIX lets you know when you've successfully logged in.
- I didn't get configure with my download.
- I didn't have autoconfig, so I got that and built it.
- Trying to run config.ac through autoconfig gave three undefined macros, 11:AM\_PATH\_CHECK 12:AM\_CONDITIONAL 16:AC\_PROG\_LIBTOOL
